A toy example page (run on PHP server) showing analysis of tweets during a Tottenham Hotspur game at the end of the 2012/2013 season.

The charts are generated using D3. The data (e.g. sentiment scores by minute, etc.) were generated using Python in the backend. This code is not stored in this repo.

All javascript is stored within the HTML file, including all data arrays.
